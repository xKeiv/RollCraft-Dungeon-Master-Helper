# RollCraft - A Dungeon Master's Toolkit and Helper

Nope, it is not another Minecraft server. It is not also something that is going to help you with building one. RollCraft is basically the toolkit in form of web app that helps you with all your demands when there is a need to oversee your TTRPGs (Tabletop RPGs) sessions when you don't want to bring all those papers with you or your campaign slash one-shot slash story is played virtually on Discord or any other communicators.
